#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

# I write a small blog to flesh out what I am learning in ML [here](about.md)

I'm a second year student of computer engineering in UPF. I'm interested in AI safety, animal ethics and existential risk.
